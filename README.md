# The Macromolecule Content and Percentage of Helical Secondary Structure in Met-Perch Hemoglobin at Various pHÂ Levels
## (Data Sourced from RCBS PDB)

For one of the assignments in a pharmaceutical chemistry course I am taking, we were tasked with exploring the online RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org) to compare the structures of pectate lyase C, serum albumin, thylakoid soluble phosphoprotein, and obestatin. The PDB is a database containing information on the three-dimensional structure of proteins, nucleic acids, etc.

While browsing the database, I came across three entries that were all for pet-merch hemoglobin but with varying pHs. I decided to use the numbers provided by the PDB to create graphs comparing the total structure weight, atom count, residue count, number of unique protein chains, and percent of helical secondary structure of hemoglobin in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) at pH levels of 5.7, 6.3, and 8.0.  My R programming code for these data visualizations can be found on GitHub and Kaggle.
